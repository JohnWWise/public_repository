Education saved my life. Education saved my life because it gave me power over my life.\nWe hear the phrase “Knowledge is power” so often that it has become cliché, but those of us who have known complete powerlessness and have been fortunate enough to gain access to education know the truth of that time-worn phrase. We cling to that truth as a drowning man to a lifeline.\nI have been incarcerated for almost seventeen years, so I happen to know many criminals. I know several of them very well. Never, in all of that time, have I ever met a man who was inherently “bad”. Instead of following the traditional flow of life, we have been swept up in sudden riptides, pulled away from our best selves by violent currents and our own internal whitewater hazards.\nHowever, those of us here today have been thrown a lifeline. Our education will keep us from being swept away by life’s random currents. It will be a vessel for us, so that we may support ourselves. It will be a ballast to stabilize us by allowing us to understand society and our roles within it. It will be the wind that we now know how to harness to fill our sails. It will be the clear night sky full of stars that we now know how to read and can use to navigate towards our dreams.\nKnowledge is power.\nI want our families to know that we are all here today because of you. Just you. This has not been easy, and we have faced many frustrations and challenges. We persevered for you. Each of us made sacrifices to be here. We made them for you. With all of the hardship and pain we have caused in our lives, we did this so that we could bring you some pride, so that you could be proud of us. We did this for you.\nI took a census of those of us graduating today; the 47 of us have a total of 73 children. We have 39 sons and 34 daughters. We did this for them. We did this so that we could be the fathers they need and the fathers they deserve. We did this so that we could support them and so that we could understand them and so that we may help them reach their dreams. We did this so that we may serve as an example to them. When we struggled, we spoke of how excited we were to share it with our families. We drove ourselves to be better for you and for you alone. Being here today, with you, has been our goal from the beginning.\nWe have brought you a victory. Thank you for being here, for sharing this victory with us. This means more to us than any of us could ever know how to say.\nFinally, I want my classmates to know, and I am speaking here to myself as well, that we really have done something powerful, meaningful, and good. I want us to take a moment to honestly reflect on that achievement. Do not let yourselves, or anyone else, convince you that the positive experience of earning a college degree can be devalued or diminished by having acquired it in prison. It is true that college is a positive and prison is a negative, but if you add the positive and the negative together, you don’t end up with zero, with nothing. To the contrary, the two experiences combine to become something greater.\nThose of us here today have spent the last two and a half years fully immersed in our studies. In many ways, we were not incarcerated; we found escape to a place where we could truly better ourselves. We have had the opportunity to engage with academic material in a way that any serious scholar would envy.\nI would not trade my Columbia Correctional Institution for a Columbia University Education, nor for any other education in the world. I could not be prouder to be among you men, to be one of your peers.\nThank you.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\n\n\nTroy wanted to take it back off, put it back in the box, and change back into his prison uniform.\nReally, he wanted to go back – back to the dorm, back to his bunk – but that feeling didn’t form into a\nconscious thought. It just stayed in the background as fear, a fear of going home that had been building\nfor months.\nIt wasn’t that he didn’t like the outfit that his family had sent him for this “big day” – a simple\ncombination of khaki pants and dress shirt – it was that the clothes felt unnatural, unsafe. He had put\nthem on, with a feeling of surrealism, and walked out of the little room in the visitation park like a\ncondemned man on the way to the gallows.\nNow he was waiting. His family was outside; he could see their car in the parking lot, through\nthe fences and wire. They were also waiting. To Troy, it felt like the whole world hung suspended on the\nedge of an abyss while the lieutenant, who had left him here, completed the last bit of mysterious\nprocessing that must be done before Troy would be a “free man”.\nTroy just sat. He sat and stared at the floor. He focused on keeping his breathing even. Free,\nthought Troy. He shook his head in denial.\n“Gavin? You still here?” The voice came from behind him. It was Officer Randall, the Inside\nGrounds supervisor. They knew each other slightly; Troy had been assigned extra duty with Randall\nonce, a few years back.\n“Yes sir.” Troy was confused. Was Randall here to tell him goodbye, to wish him good luck? He\nhad obviously come to the visitation park looking for Troy specifically.\n“I’ve got a piss test here for you. I’m glad I caught you before you left,” Randall said\nconversationally as he reached into a manila envelope. He extracted a little clear plastic jar with an\norange lid and tossed it into the air. With a feeling of absolute terror, Troy watched the jar’s flight. It\nlanded in Randall’s palm with the sound of a thunderclap, the sound of the earth cracking open for the\nentire world to fall into.\nTroy had smoked some pot, for the first time in at least five years, just last night. He had\nthought it would help him sleep; it hadn’t, but he hadn’t known what else to do. He had been so\nnervous about going home he’d had less than three hours of sleep every night for weeks. He didn’t even\nthink they did piss tests anymore. With there being so much synthetic trash in the prison system, next to\nno one tested positive for marijuana.\n“But, I’m going home today…” Troy stammered.\n“Not if you don’t pass this test, you’re not!” Randall countered with a casual, amused air; it was\nobvious that Randall hadn’t considered the possibility that Troy was dirty. “You fail this test, I gotta give\nya the full clip: sixty days in the box and one-hundred eighty days loss gain-time. Could you imagine?\nThat would suck! I don’t even know why ya’ll that’re going homes names’ appear on these lists, but this\nhas happened a few times. Some computer in Tallahassee makes the lists. ‘Puter don’t care that you\ngoin’ home. Ready?”\nTroy watched himself take the jar from Randall’s hand. He didn’t know what else to do, so he\njust watched. He watched himself cross the visitation park to the bathroom. He watched himself open\nthe door and step inside. Troy instinctively tried to shut the door behind him, to lock himself away from\nthe world until he could come to terms with what was going on, but of course, Randall was right behind\nhim.\n“Alright, pants and boxers all the way down around your ankles, you know the drill.” Randall\ninstructed matter-of-factly.\nTroy did as he was told. He stood in front of the toilet with a jar in one hand and his penis in the\nother. He stood there like that for several moments, staring at this strange tableau: toilet, jar, penis, and\nkhaki pants bunched up around his ankles. There were plaid boxers too. Plaid boxers? I’m supposed to\ngo home today, Troy recalled numbly.\n“I bet you’re ready to go, how long you been down?” Randall asked. His voice seemed to boom\noff the walls of the tiny bathroom. He was standing less than three feet from Troy.\n“Um, nineteen years,” Troy replied emptily. Really, he’d been locked up for eighteen years and\nnine months, but the difference didn’t seem to matter to Troy much. Not now.\n“Shit man, I can’t imagine how you must feel. Where you goin’?” Randall asked casually, as\nthough he was out having a beer with Troy and not standing next to him while he tried to urinate into a\nplastic jar.\n“Vermont. My folks drove down to pick me up…” Troy was starting to feel like he might pass\nout. Everything was spinning. A few drops of urine spread across the bottom of the jar, then a spurt. As\nTroy began to urinate fully, he watched the urine. The jar caused it to follow a circular path; it was a\ncounterclockwise yellow whirlpool of piss.\nApparently, the urine was swirling in the opposite direction as the room, because Troy felt\nsteadied in watching it.\n“Vermont! Hey, that’s enough piss. Go ahead and cap that jar and clean up.” Randall told him.\n“Man, you better not come back to this shit. Got a family up in Vermont…”\nTroy was beginning to get his bearings now. As Randall placed the jar on the visitation park table\nand prepared the testing kit, Troy began to think about how he could smooth talk Randall into helping\nhim get through this last barrier to freedom. Randall, after all, was a human being. Troy was sure he’d\nunderstand. He could talk to Randall.\nMaybe he wouldn’t even have to. Maybe it hadn’t been long enough for the drug to get to his\nurine. Maybe the test wouldn’t work.\n“How does that thing work?” Troy asked.\nJust then, the lieutenant came back into the room. Troy had forgotten about him. Troy felt his\nheart stop; a hole opened up where his stomach used to be, and he fell into that hole. He had no hope of talking his way out of this now…“Well,” Randall replied, oblivious to Troy’s internal death, “when the\npiss hits this paper here, it either gets a line across it if you are clean or no line if you are dirty. That line\nshould pop up here right away… Well, we’ll just give it a second…\n”The lieutenant came over and peered down onto the test as well. There was a long, silent\npause as the three men contemplated the tiny piece of plastic-enclosed urine-soaked paper. No line\nappeared.\n“You dirty son?” the lieutenant finally asked Troy.\n“I, um… yeah. I smoked a little pot last night so that I could sleep. I didn’t even really get high… I\njust needed to sleep…” Troy was sure they would understand. It was just a little pot, they would\nunderstand.\nAfter another long, full silence, the lieutenant sighed. He turned to Randall and said, “Cuff him\nup. Shit. He probably wouldn’t have made it three months out there anyhow.”\nTroy turned away and put his hands behind his back. He turned away in anger; he turned away\nin shame. He was now facing the parking lot. Through the window he saw his father and daughter\nstanding outside his father’s car. He saw them through the fences and the wire. He hadn’t known his\ndaughter was going to be there… Who was the young child with her?\nTroy wondered, Am I a grandfather? He hadn’t seen or heard from her in years… What would\nshe think of him now? What was their ride back across the country going to be like? Would he ever see\nher again? Her image blurred through his tears. Randall’s handcuffs felt familiar. The sound of their\ntightening comforted him, somehow fortified him. This realization disgusted Troy.\nTroy could hear the lieutenant on the telephone behind him, “Yeah, I know, world’s dumbest\ncriminal, right? The paperwork is going to be a nightmare; someone’s got to tell the family…huh? I\nhadn’t thought of that…”\nA long pause…\n“Okay, yeah, no problem… Yeah.” The lieutenant sounded disappointed. Click.\n“Randall, you gotta take those cuffs back offa him. I don’t know what I was thinking,” The\nlieutenant chuckled.\nAs the handcuffs were removed, Troy felt hope surge into his heart. Was this what it took Troy\nto finally realize that he did want to go home? If so, he was grateful. He now knew he was ready. He had\nimagined himself walking through the gates thousands of times; now he imagined himself, for the first\ntime, walking through the gates with a smile on his face. I’m going home! Troy triumphantly announced\nto himself. Troy rubbed the marks on his wrists that the handcuffs had left behind.\n“He’s gotta take that bullshit back off. I can’t take him to the box dressed like that.” The\nlieutenant said. “You hear that, dummy? Put your uniform back on!”\n\n\n\n",
