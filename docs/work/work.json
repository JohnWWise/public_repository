This page lists all deaths that occurred throughout the department during the preceding fiscal year. The webpage provides data for fiscal years 2017-2018 up to the present and can be accessed at Inmate Mortality – Florida Department of Corrections (myflorida.com).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Source: Screenshot 2023-09-04 at 11.27.33 AM | Florida Department of Corrections\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Source: Screenshot 2023-09-04 at 11.34.04 AM | Florida Department of Corrections\n\n\nIt is remarkable and surprising that the FDOC chose to openly post this data (this point requires further support). In my data science training, however, I have learned that data is usually presented in this way only when there is a story to tell or a point to make. By presenting the data in this way, it becomes a communication tool, and one story in partiular has been intentionally centered here by the Florida Department of Corrections: the vast majority of deaths inside are “natural,” which is listed first under “Mortality Facts” and emphasized through the use of a pie chart. The third item in this list of “facts” serves to reinforce this point, and the table of the number of deaths separated by manner of death presented alongside this visual is used as an opportunity to juxtapose the total inmate population. The FDOC’s story is clear: given such a large incarcerated population entering with pre-existing medical conditions, natural deaths are inevitable but slight in comparison to the total number of persons under their care.\n\n“On average, people should be more skeptical when they see numbers. They should be more willing to play around with the data themselves.” – Nate Silver, founder, and editor-in-chief of FiveThirtyEight.\n\nFortunately, in addition to these summary statistics, the FDOC also posts tables of deaths, and these raw data are quite informative.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Source: Screenshot 2023-09-04 at 12.20.33 PM | Florida Department of Corrections\n\n\nThis paper utilizes these lists for the fiscal years 2015 - present. Although the webpage itself only links to data tables going back to the FY 2017-2018, the FDOC has been publishing said tables since 2015, and links to the fiscal years 2015-16. and 2017-18 were made available to the author via a direct request to the FDOC’s Department of Research and Data.\nThe Raw Data\nWhile many records lack names and the manner of death, the FDOC data does contain 3,497 death observations, each of which is accompanied by a “Date of Death”. The earliest recorded date of death is July 2nd, 2015, and the latest is July 31st, 2023. To begin, I have compiled the data into a sortable and searchable data table.\n\n\nShow code\n\npkgs = c(\"tidyverse\",\n         \"ggplot2\",\n         \"kableExtra\",\n         \"outliers\",\n         \"boot\",\n         \"forcats\",\n         \"DT\",\n         \"plotly\",\n         \"gridExtra\",\n         \"leaflet\",\n         \"htmltools\",\n         \"purrr\",\n         \"RColorBrewer\",\n         \"readxl\",\n         \"waffle\",\n         \"ggforce\",\n         \"viridis\")\ninst = lapply(pkgs, library, character.only = TRUE)\nset.seed(8675309)\n\n\n\n\nShow code\n\n# Here we are bringing in our csv files -- I copied and pasted the FDOC tables into spreadsheets and saved them as csvs. The coordinates of FDOC facilities were manually looked up by me on Google maps.\n\n# base directory for CSV files\nbase_dir <- \"/Users/johnwise/pubic_repository/csvs/fdoc_mortality/\"\n\n# Define a function to read and preprocess CSV files\nread_and_preprocess_csv <- function(file_path) {\n  #

This is because the RMC is the secure medical facility for the entire Florida Department of Corrections, and includes a hospital on site where individuals in need of hospitalization or specialty medical care are housed. The facility was founded in 1968 as an intake and processing point for all male state prisoners and as a secure medical facility.\n\n\nShow code\n\nper_month_all2 <- deaths %>%\n  group_by(FACILITY_description, month = floor_date(Date_Death, unit = \"month\")) %>%\n  summarise(Total_month_Deaths = n()) %>%\n  mutate(Facility_obs_count = sum(Total_month_Deaths))\n\nper_month_rmc_keyed <- per_month_all2 %>% mutate(RMC = FACILITY_description == 'R.M.C.- MAIN UNIT')\n\nggplot(per_month_rmc_keyed, aes(x = as.Date(month), y = Total_month_Deaths, fill = RMC)) + \n  geom_rect(aes(xmin = as.Date(\"2020-03-09\"), xmax = as.Date(\"2021-08-25\"), ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf), fill = \"lightpink\", alpha = 0.3) +\n  geom_col() + \n  scale_x_date(date_labels = \"%B, %Y\", date_breaks = \"6 months\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = as.Date(c(\"2015-07-02\", \"2023-06-29\"))) +\n  xlab(NULL) +\n  ylab('Count') +\n  labs(fill = \"\", title = \"FDOC Deaths -- RMC/Not-RMC:\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\",\n        legend.direction = \"horizontal\",\n        legend.key.width = unit(1, \"cm\"),\n        legend.text = element_text(size = 10),\n        legend.key = element_rect(fill = c(\"blue\", \"lightpink\"), color = \"gray\")) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"FALSE\" = \"blue\", \"TRUE\" = \"black\"),\n                    labels = c(\"Non Lake Butler RMC Death\", \"Lake Butler RMC Death\")) +\n  annotate(geom=\"text\", label='2020 COVID 19 Florida Emergency', x=as.Date('2020-12-09'), y=-1.75, size=2.5)\n\n\n\nThe plot above displays the total number of deaths over time for the period covered by our data. It has been separated into Lake Butler and Non-Lake Butler deaths to better understand the contribution of deaths from Lake Butler and to highlight that the total number of deaths in the Florida Department of Corrections is largely determined by the frequency of deaths at Lake Butler RMC.\nIn my experience, Lake Butler, Florida is one of the most dangerous sites in the prison system in terms of assaults on the incarcerated population by staff. During my time incarcerated in Florida, I was personally housed at Lake Butler RMC on multiple occasions, due to the medical problems I experienced surrounding my food allergies while incarcerated, and I was there a total of about a year altogether. During that time, I personally witnessed many acts of violence and assault, most from staff members onto the incarcerated population, but equally as often did I see violence among the incarcerated population that was encouraged by a complicit staff.\nFor example, sometime around 2012, ten years into my sentence, I was sent back to Lake Butler RMC from my facility and was housed at the main unit in “I Block” for four months. This building was constructed shortly after the facility was opened. When I first entered the building with my property, I climbed a dark set of stairs. At the top of the flight, however, I found only a set of cell bars blocking the office area beyond the landing. In the office, behind a desk, a Sargent sat chatting with a shift officer. Moreover, on the landing at the top of the stairs, there was only concrete, but a set of footprints was painted onto the floor, facing the cinderblocks and only inches away.\nAlone and with no instructions, I stepped into the footprints and stood, nose to the wall and holding my property hanging by my arms at my side. After some time had passed, I heard a laugh and the sergeant say “you can throw him down the stairs if you need to.” That’s when I noticed that my feet had come off the footprints. In a panic, I fixed my feet and glanced behind me to see if I was still in danger. The sergeant had instructed one of his “run around” orderlies (an incarcerated person like myself) to fix my feet for me. Seeing that I’d done so myself, the orderly hesitated, obviously relieved, and the sergeant only laughed. Normally, just looking away from the wall would have been enough to merit violence, so I took his laugh as real evidence that I’d escaped harm by realizing on my own that my feet were misplaced.\nI myself ended up working as a runaround, and I worked for that sergeant for about four months. Though I managed to avoid committing violence on his behalf (much to his disappointment), I would not say that those four months were without trauma. Sergeant Moran has since been convicted of plotting to murder a former inmate, along with two other staff members, all of whom have been linked to the racist hate organization, the KKK.\nI have seen officers at Lake Butler RMC jumping up and down on incapacitated person’s faces. I have seen grown men slapped open-handed in the face by ‘correctional officers’ at Lake Butler RMC in front of hundreds of other men more times than I can count. I have seen officers at Lake Butler RMC smash a 17 year old child’s face through a pane of security glass (the kind with the wire in it) because of “his attitude”, and the next day they had a piece of paper with a smily face drawn on it taped over the broken glass.\nLake Butler Reception Medical Center is a bad place. For context, consider a similar institution: The Florida School for Boys, also known as the Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys. This reform school operated in the panhandle town of Marianna (equidistant from Talahassee as Lake Butler, but on the opposite side) from January 1, 1900, to June 30, 2011. Throughout its 111-year history, the school gained a reputation for abuse, beatings, rapes, torture, and even murder of students by staff. Despite periodic investigations, changes of leadership, and promises to improve, the allegations of cruelty and abuse continued. In 2009, after the school failed a state inspection, the governor ordered a full investigation. Separate investigations by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement in 2010 and by the Civil Rights Division of the United States Department of Justice in 2011 confirmed many of the historic and recent allegations of abuse and violence. State authorities closed the school permanently in June 2011. The University of South Florida conducted a forensic anthropology survey authorized by the state, which identified 55 burials on the grounds, most outside the cemetery, and documented nearly 100 deaths at the school.\nTo me and thousands of Florida citizens, Lake Butler Reception Medical Center represents a still-existent Dozier School, only for adults. The culture and norms that formed and supported the Dozier School are still present at Lake Butler, and it still today continues to act as a site of white racist repression, violence, and hate.\nI am greatly saddened that anyone would have to die there, in that nightmare of a place and wholly separated from those they love.\nHomicides\nHomicides By Facility\nThe chart below shows the number of homicides by facility. While it is possible that many of the homicides at Lake Butler RMC are individuals who were attacked at other facilities and then transferred to Lake Butler for medical treatment and subsequently counted as Lake Butler deaths (I’m sure any FDOC official would argue this to be the case), I personally don’t believe that this fully accounts for the entire homicide count at Lake Butler RMC.\n\n\nShow code\n\nviolent_FDOC <- deaths %>%\n  filter(Manner_Death ==\"Homicide\") %>%\n  mutate(month = floor_date(Date_Death, \"week\")) %>%\n  select(Date_Death, FACILITY_description)\n\nggplot(violent_FDOC, aes(x = reorder(FACILITY_description, FACILITY_description, function(x) length(x)))) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  geom_text(aes(label = ..count..), stat = \"count\", size =3.25, hjust = 1.5, color = \"white\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  xlab(\"FDOC Facilities\") + \n  ylab(\"Homicide Count\") +\n  scale_y_discrete(labels = scales::label_number(scale = 1)) +\n  ggtitle(\"FDOC Homicides by Facility July 2015- June 2023\") +\n  labs(caption = \"Figure 5\")\n\n\n\nAccidental Deaths\n\n\nShow code\n\nper_week_all4 <- deaths %>%\n  filter(Manner_Death== 'Accident') %>%\n  group_by(week = floor_date(Date_Death, unit = \"week\")) %>%\n  summarise(Total_week_Deaths = n())\n\nt_value <- function(data, indices) {\n  scores <- scores(data[indices], type = \"t\")\n  abs(scores)\n}\n# Bootstrap:\nboot_tee <- boot(per_week_all4$Total_week_Deaths, t_value, R = 10000)\nper_week_all4$p_values <- 1 - pnorm(boot_tee$t0)\nper_week_all4$high <- per_week_all4$p_values<=0.05\n\nggplot(per_week_all4, aes(x = week, y= Total_week_Deaths, col= high)) +\n  geom_rect(aes(xmin = as.Date(\"2020-03-09\"), xmax = as.Date(\"2021-08-25\"), ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf), fill = \"lightpink\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_col() +\n  scale_x_date(date_labels = \"%B, %Y\", date_breaks = \"6 months\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = as.Date(c(\"2015-07-02\", \"2023-06-29\"))) +\n  xlab(NULL) +\n  ylab('Count of Accidents') +\n  guides(color='none') +\n  annotate(geom=\"text\", label='2020 COVID 19 Florida Emergency', x=as.Date('2020-12-09'), y=-.25, size=2.5)\n\n\n\nThe plot above shows the historical rate of occurrence of accidents resulting in deaths over the entire period covered by our data. To explain the coloration, the scores() algorithm utilizes the historical information available on frequency of accidental deaths to assess the probability of a given week being both ‘usual’ and having as many accidental deaths observed in that week as seen. The weeks that we see above displayed in blue are those weeks in which that calculated probability is less than 5%.\nThis spate of accidental deaths, it seems, did catch the notice of the Tampa Bay Times. According to the Times, the Florida prison system has long been considered one of the most dangerous in the US, with issues including inmate-on-inmate violence, use-of-force by staff, and problems with delivery of health care. At the time, they reported that the Florida Department of Corrections is investigating the causes of the spike, with an increase in overdoses on synthetic drugs like K2 being pointed to as a possible contributing factor. https://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/Record-number-of-inmates-died-in-Florida-prisons-last-year-And-they-died-younger-than-past-years-_164715214/\nSynthetic cannabinoids, also known as Spice or K2, are human-made chemicals designed to mimic the effects of THC, the primary psychoactive compound found in marijuana. They are often sprayed onto plant material and sold in small packages as a legal alternative to marijuana. The chemicals used to make synthetic cannabinoids are often changing, making them difficult to regulate and control. Synthetic cannabinoids entered the prison system around 2012, but it wasn’t until around 2016 that they became so prevalent that they were as easy to find as tobacco.\nThe chemicals used to make synthetic cannabinoids used around 2017, it seems, were particularly troublesome. That stuff was everywhere.

Any facilities which individually and independently experienced high death counts of statistical significance in the same month were plotted, as well as results that were not necessarily statistically significant but high enough to be considered when searching for spatial patterns linking significant results (p ≤ 0.25).\nThe plotting algorithm automatically fits the mapping as tightly as possible but keeps the size of the marker proportional to the magnitude of the mapped effect, in this case p-values (the calculated probability that a given week is ‘usual’). It is important to note that, when viewing these maps, the sizes of the circles remain constant regardless of zoom level. Comparing the magnitude of effect across different maps is valid, but it should be done with caution, as the size of the marker does not correspond to an area of land covered.\nIt is not valid to compare colorations across maps at this time, as the colors of each map cover the spectrum of their respective associated data entries (this is a coding issue – frustrating – i hope to soon fix).\n2015\nDecember 2015\n\n\nShow code\n\ndata <- interesting %>% filter(month == '2015-12-01')\n\nmanners <- deaths %>%\n  filter(month(Date_Death) == 12 & year(Date_Death) == 2015) %>%\n  group_by(FACILITY_description, Manner_Death) %>% \n  summarise(count = n()) %>% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = Manner_Death, values_from = count, values_fill = 0) %>%\n  select(FACILITY_description, everything())\n\n# Define a continuous color palette\npalette_name <- \"YlOrRd\"\nnum_colors <- 9  # Number of colors in the palette\ncolors <- brewer.pal(n = num_colors, name = palette_name)[(num_colors / 2 + 1):num_colors]\npal <- colorNumeric(palette = colors, domain = sqrt(sqrt(1/data$p_values)))\n\n\nleaflet(data) %>%\n  addTiles() %>%\n  addCircleMarkers(\n    radius = ~sqrt(sqrt(1/p_values)),\n    color = ~pal(sqrt(sqrt(1/p_values))),\n    fillOpacity = .45,\n    stroke = TRUE,\n    label = ~paste(\n      FACILITY_description\n    ),\n    labelOptions = labelOptions(\n      noHide = TRUE,          # Keep the label open by default\n      direction = \"auto\",      # Position of the label relative to the marker\n      textOnly = FALSE,        # Display only text (no HTML content)\n      textsize = \"12px\",\n      opacity = 1,\n      offset = c(0,0),\n      style = list(\"white-space\" = \"nowrap\", \"font-weight\" = \"bold\"))  # CSS styles for the label\n    ) %>%\n  addControl(\n    position = \"bottomleft\",\n    html = \"<b style='font-size: 28px;'>December 2015<\/b>\"\n  )\n\n\n\nShow code\n\nkable(data %>% select(FACILITY_description,Total_month_naturalDeaths,p_values,high)) %>% \n  kable_styling(latex_options = \"hold_position\")\n\n\nFACILITY_description\n\n\nTotal_month_naturalDeaths\n\n\np_values\n\n\nhigh\n\n\nAPALACHEE EAST UNIT\n\n\n2\n\n\n0.0086009\n\n\nTRUE\n\n\nCHARLOTTE C.I.\n\n\n2\n\n\n0.0437882\n\n\nTRUE\n\n\nDADE C.I.\n\n\n1\n\n\n0.2409548\n\n\nFALSE\n\n\nUNION C.I.\n\n\n3\n\n\n0.1204806\n\n\nFALSE\n\n\n2016\nJanuary 2016\n\n\n\nFACILITY_description\n\n\nTotal_month_naturalDeaths\n\n\np_values\n\n\nhigh\n\n\nDADE C.I.\n\n\n1\n\n\n0.2409548\n\n\nFALSE\n\n\nS.F.R.C.\n\n\n7\n\n\n0.0068091\n\n\nTRUE\n\n\nSOUTH BAY C.F.\n\n\n2\n\n\n0.1458386\n\n\nFALSE\n\n\nSUMTER C.I.\n\n\n3\n\n\n0.0000010\n\n\nTRUE\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nFACILITY_description\n\n\nTotal_month_naturalDeaths\n\n\np_values\n\n\nhigh\n\n\nCHARLOTTE C.I.\n\n\n2\n\n\n0.0437882\n\n\nTRUE\n\n\nLAKE C.I.\n\n\n2\n\n\n0.0017074\n\n\nTRUE\n\n\nLOWELL ANNEX\n\n\n2\n\n\n0.0038738\n\n\nTRUE\n\n\nR.M.C.- MAIN UNIT\n\n\n6\n\n\n0.1150042\n\n\nFALSE\n\n\nJune 2016\n\n\n\nFACILITY_description\n\n\nTotal_month_naturalDeaths\n\n\np_values\n\n\nhigh\n\n\nGULF C.I.- ANNEX\n\n\n3\n\n\n3.90e-06\n\n\nTRUE\n\n\nNWFRC MAIN UNIT.\n\n\n2\n\n\n1.33e-05\n\n\nTRUE\n\n\nJuly 2016\n\n\n\nFACILITY_description\n\n\nTotal_month_naturalDeaths\n\n\np_values\n\n\nhigh\n\n\nCHARLOTTE C.I.\n\n\n2\n\n\n0.0437882\n\n\nTRUE\n\n\nR.M.C.- MAIN UNIT\n\n\n20\n\n\n0.0266139\n\n\nTRUE\n\n\nS.F.R.C.\n\n\n8\n\n\n0.0008944\n\n\nTRUE\n\n\n2018\nJanuary 2018\n\n\n\nFACILITY_description\n\n\nTotal_month_naturalDeaths\n\n\np_values\n\n\nhigh\n\n\nEVERGLADES C.I.\n\n\n2\n\n\n0.0623552\n\n\nFALSE\n\n\nHARDEE C.I.\n\n\n2\n\n\n0.0000010\n\n\nTRUE\n\n\nR.M.C.- MAIN UNIT\n\n\n21\n\n\n0.0150634\n\n\nTRUE\n\n\nS.F.R.C.\n\n\n1\n\n\n0.1427063\n\n\nFALSE\n\n\nSUWANNEE C.I.
