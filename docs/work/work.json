The Florida Department of Corrections (FDOC) seems to appreciate repeat customers; I’ve heard them say so myself.\nFurthermore, the average number of times a person has been incarcerated across the entire population is 2.17. In other words, the average person currently incarcerated in FDOC has been incarcerated more than twice before.\nWhat does this information imply about the argument for incarceration as a deterrent?\nRegarding the argument on incarceration as a deterrent, I pose this question: How many crimes has the threat of incarceration prevented YOU from committing?\nIf your answer is “none,” then you are likely in the majority.\nIf your response is “none, but I’m not a criminal,” then it is worth reflecting on the following: Who are the criminals? What do they look like? Where do they come from? Which neighborhoods do they reside in? How comfortable are you with your answers?\nTime Free Since Last Release\nNext, we should examine the amount of time that those who are currently incarcerated in Florida were free in between their current and their last incarceration:\n\n\nShow code\n\nquartiles <- round(quantile(returners_a$TimeOut, probs = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))/365.25, 1)\n\ncolor_palette <- c(\"#ffffff\", \"#e6e6e6\", \"#bfbfbf\", \"#808080\", \"#404040\", \"#000000\")\n\n\n\n# Create the first plot (plota)\nplota <- ggplot(returners_a, aes(x = 1, y = TimeOut / 365.25, color = prev_TimeServed_bins, group = 1)) +\n  geom_sina(alpha = 0.5, position = 'dodge') +\n  geom_violin(alpha = 0.1, color = \"black\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = color_palette, name = 'Served') +\n  ylab(\"Years Free\") +\n  theme_void() +  # Remove axis and grid lines\n  theme(axis.text.y = element_text()) +  # Keep y-axis labels\n  labs(title = \"Years Free, Shaded by Previous Fl. Time Served\")\n\n\ncolor_palette <- c(\"#ffffff\", \"#e6e6e6\", \"#404040\", \"#000000\")\n\n# Create the second plot (plotb)\nplotb <- ggplot(returners_a, aes(x = 1, y = TimeOut / 365.25, color = times_in_bins, group = 1)) +\n  geom_sina(alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_violin(alpha = 0.1, color = \"black\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = color_palette, name = 'Number of Bids') +\n  ylab(NULL) +\n  theme_void() +  # Remove axis and grid lines\n  theme(axis.text.y = element_text()) +  # Keep y-axis labels\n  labs(title = \"Years Free, Shaded by Number of Incarcerations\")\n\n# Customize plot margins for both plots\nplota <- plota + theme(plot.margin = margin(0, 0, 0, 0, unit = \"pt\"))\nplotb <- plotb + theme(plot.margin = margin(0, 0, 0, 0, unit = \"pt\"))\n\n# Arrange the plots using grid.arrange\ngrid.arrange(plota, plotb, ncol = 2, top = \"Respite Amidst Most Recent Incarcerations, Current FDOC Population\")\n\n\n\nIt is evident from the visuals that a majority of individuals currently incarcerated in Florida with a history of previous FDOC incarceration did not have a significant period of freedom before their current imprisonment. Interestingly, there is also a pattern where individuals who had served long sentences in the past or multiple sentences were unable to remain free for long before being incarcerated again. These patterns are shown by the darker points towards the bottom of the visuals. While one might (naively) expect that spending more time in prison or having multiple sentences would make individuals better equipped to stay out longer and remain free, in reality it is not surprising to see evidence here that the longer someone is inside, the less equipped they are to navigate the challenges after release.\nTime Free\n\n\nShow code\n\nquartile_table <- data.frame(\n  \"Quartile\" = c(\"Q1\", \"Median (Q2)\", \"Q3\"),\n  Years_Free = quartiles\n)\n\nkable(quartile_table) %>% \n  kable_styling(latex_options = \"hold_position\")\n\n\n\n\nQuartile\n\n\nYears_Free\n\n\n25%\n\n\nQ1\n\n\n1.8\n\n\n50%\n\n\nMedian (Q2)\n\n\n3.2\n\n\n75%\n\n\nQ3\n\n\n5.7\n\n\nFor individuals who are currently incarcerated and have previously served time in Florida, a quarter of them were returned to prison in less than 1.8 years after their most recent release, while half of them were not out longer than 3.2 years. Furthermore, only 25% of them managed to stay out of prison for more than 5.7 years.\nIt is clear that many people are going back to prison very quickly, which raises concerns.\nThink about this, however: having 3.2 years of freedom is actually enough time for someone to regain some responsibilities and dignity – it is already difficult to regain these once (or maybe gain them for the first time), but to only have a fleeting taste of them? I do not know that I could recover from something like that.\nCharges\nFor each person who is currently incarcerated and has at least one prior incarceration, we have data on all adjudications for their current and past incarcerations.\nRegarding those currently incarcerated, we observe that they are serving time for a wide range of adjudication charges. There are 863 different charges for which these individuals are currently incarcerated.\n\n\nreturners_hist <- merge(returners_a, Offenses_CPS, by = 'DCNumber')\nreturners_hist$adjudicationcharge_descr <- as.factor(returners_hist$adjudicationcharge_descr)\n\ncharges <- returners_hist %>%\n  group_by(adjudicationcharge_descr) %>%\n  summarize(charge_count = n()) %>%\n  arrange(desc(charge_count))\ncharges\n\n# A tibble: 863 × 2\n   adjudicationcharge_descr      charge_count\n   <fct>                                <int>\n 1 BURGUNOCCSTRUC/CV OR ATT.            26814\n 2 BURG/DWELL/OCCUP.CONVEY              19402\n 3 GRAND THEFT,300 L/5,000              18305\n 4 COCAINE - POSSESSION                 14918\n 5 GRAND THEFT MOTOR VEHICLE            12685\n 6 COCAINE-SALE/MANUF/DELIV.            11092\n 7 TRAFFIC IN STOLEN PROPERTY            9885\n 8 ROBB.

I had to make numerous decisions regarding the classification of crimes which often felt arbitrary even to myself. It is important to note that there are many other equally valid, and possibly even superior, crime categorization schemas. Furthermore, please be aware that crime categories are actively being reviewed and adjusted. If you come across any errors or inconsistencies, or would like have an alternate schema considered, please contact me.\nI do not like how low the Probation/Parole Violations seem to be, seems to be an error almost, so the next step is to investigate that surprising result throughly.\n\n\nwrk <- returners_hist %>% select(DCNumber, crime_category)\nresult <- wrk %>% \n  group_by(DCNumber) %>% \n  mutate(crimes_categories = paste(crime_category, collapse = \"; \")) %>%\n  select(-crime_category) %>%\n  unique()\n\n\n\n\nresult <- result %>%\n  separate_rows(crimes_categories, sep = \"; \") %>%\n  count(DCNumber, crimes_categories) %>%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = crimes_categories, values_from = n, values_fill = 0)\n\n\nHere we have my first pass at establishing the proportions of currently incarcerated returning persons assocated with each crime category.\n\n\nresult_df <- data.frame(Category = character(0), Proportion = numeric(0))\ncategories <- colnames(result)[-1]\nfor (category in categories) {\n  num_associated_rows <- result %>%\n    filter(get(category) > 0) %>%\n    nrow()\n  proportion <- round(num_associated_rows / nrow(result), 2)\n  result_df <- rbind(result_df, data.frame(Category = category, Proportion = proportion))\n}\nprint(result_df)\n\n                                    Category Proportion\n1           Burglary, Theft, Property Crimes       0.54\n2                             Violent Crimes       0.42\n3  Crimes of Incarceration/Criminal Identity       0.27\n4                              Drug Offenses       0.49\n5                                      Other       0.27\n6                                 Sex Crimes       0.09\n7                     White-Collar and Fraud       0.14\n8                       Abuse/Neglect Crimes       0.02\n9                       Motor Vechile Crimes       0.08\n10               Probation/Parole Violations       0.00\n\nIn the analysis, it is observed that among the individuals currently incarcerated in FDOC who have previously served time in FDOC, 54% have at least one Burglary, Theft, or Property crime associated with their current incarceration, while 42% have been associated with at least one crime from the violent crime category, and so on. The proportions sum to greater than 100 because many individuals are associated with multiple crime categories.\nI believe the count for Probation/Parole Violations is shockingly low because the FDOC may classify individuals who are currently incarcerated and have violated their probation/parole as adjudicated under the charge for which they were originally sentenced to probation. If this is the case, and I have not simply misclassified a probation/parole violation as a different crime, it will make our analysis more challenging and limited in scope. I am currently investigating the situation and exploring potential ways to address this issue.\n\n\n\n",

This page lists all deaths that occurred throughout the department during the preceding fiscal year. The webpage provides data for fiscal years 2017-2018 up to the present and can be accessed at Inmate Mortality – Florida Department of Corrections (myflorida.com).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Source: Screenshot 2023-09-04 at 11.27.33 AM | Florida Department of Corrections\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Source: Screenshot 2023-09-04 at 11.34.04 AM | Florida Department of Corrections\n\n\nIt is remarkable and surprising that the FDOC chose to openly post this data (this point requires further support). In my data science training, however, I have learned that data is usually presented in this way only when there is a story to tell or a point to make. By presenting the data in this way, it becomes a communication tool, and one story in partiular has been intentionally centered here by the Florida Department of Corrections: the vast majority of deaths inside are “natural,” which is listed first under “Mortality Facts” and emphasized through the use of a pie chart. The third item in this list of “facts” serves to reinforce this point, and the table of the number of deaths separated by manner of death presented alongside this visual is used as an opportunity to juxtapose the total inmate population. The FDOC’s story is clear: given such a large incarcerated population entering with pre-existing medical conditions, natural deaths are inevitable but slight in comparison to the total number of persons under their care.\n\n“On average, people should be more skeptical when they see numbers. They should be more willing to play around with the data themselves.” – Nate Silver, founder, and editor-in-chief of FiveThirtyEight.\n\nFortunately, in addition to these summary statistics, the FDOC also posts tables of deaths, and these raw data are quite informative.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Source: Screenshot 2023-09-04 at 12.20.33 PM | Florida Department of Corrections\n\n\nThis paper utilizes these lists for the fiscal years 2015 - present. Although the webpage itself only links to data tables going back to the FY 2017-2018, the FDOC has been publishing said tables since 2015, and links to the fiscal years 2015-16. and 2017-18 were made available to the author via a direct request to the FDOC’s Department of Research and Data.\nThe Raw Data\nWhile many records lack names and the manner of death, the FDOC data does contain 3,497 death observations, each of which is accompanied by a “Date of Death”. The earliest recorded date of death is July 2nd, 2015, and the latest is July 31st, 2023.

This is because the RMC is the secure medical facility for the entire Florida Department of Corrections, and includes a hospital on site where individuals in need of hospitalization or specialty medical care are housed. The facility was founded in 1968 as an intake and processing point for all male state prisoners and as a secure medical facility.\n\n\nShow code\n\nper_month_all2 <- deaths %>%\n  group_by(FACILITY_description, month = floor_date(Date_Death, unit = \"month\")) %>%\n  summarise(Total_month_Deaths = n()) %>%\n  mutate(Facility_obs_count = sum(Total_month_Deaths))\n\nper_month_rmc_keyed <- per_month_all2 %>% mutate(RMC = FACILITY_description == 'R.M.C.- MAIN UNIT')\n\nggplot(per_month_rmc_keyed, aes(x = as.Date(month), y = Total_month_Deaths, fill = RMC)) + \n  geom_rect(aes(xmin = as.Date(\"2020-03-09\"), xmax = as.Date(\"2021-08-25\"), ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf), fill = \"lightpink\", alpha = 0.3) +\n  geom_col() + \n  scale_x_date(date_labels = \"%B, %Y\", date_breaks = \"6 months\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = as.Date(c(\"2015-07-02\", \"2023-06-29\"))) +\n  xlab(NULL) +\n  ylab('Count') +\n  labs(fill = \"\", title = \"Monthly FDOC Deaths -- RMC/Not-RMC:\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\",\n        legend.direction = \"horizontal\",\n        legend.key.width = unit(1, \"cm\"),\n        legend.text = element_text(size = 10),\n        legend.key = element_rect(fill = c(\"blue\", \"lightpink\"), color = \"gray\")) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"FALSE\" = \"blue\", \"TRUE\" = \"black\"),\n                    labels = c(\"Non Lake Butler RMC Death\", \"Lake Butler RMC Death\")) +\n  annotate(geom=\"text\", label='2020 COVID 19 Florida Emergency', x=as.Date('2020-12-09'), y=-1.75, size=2.5) +\n  labs(caption = \"Figure 4\")\n\n\n\nThe plot above displays the total number of deaths over time for the period covered by our data. It has been separated into Lake Butler and Non-Lake Butler deaths to better understand the contribution of deaths from Lake Butler and to highlight that the total number of deaths in the Florida Department of Corrections is largely determined by the frequency of deaths at Lake Butler RMC.\nIn my experience, Lake Butler, Florida is one of the most dangerous sites in the prison system in terms of assaults on the incarcerated population by staff. During my time incarcerated in Florida, I was personally housed at Lake Butler RMC on multiple occasions, due to the medical problems I experienced surrounding my food allergies while incarcerated, and I was there a total of about a year altogether. During that time, I personally witnessed many acts of violence and assault, most from staff members onto the incarcerated population, but equally as often did I see violence among the incarcerated population that was encouraged by a complicit staff.\nFor example, sometime around 2012, ten years into my sentence, I was sent back to Lake Butler RMC from my facility and was housed at the main unit in “I Block” for four months. This building was constructed shortly after the facility was opened. When I first entered the building with my property, I climbed a dark set of stairs. At the top of the flight, however, I found only a set of cell bars blocking the office area beyond the landing. In the office, behind a desk, a Sargent sat chatting with a shift officer. Moreover, on the landing at the top of the stairs, there was only concrete, but a set of footprints was painted onto the floor, facing the cinderblocks and only inches away.\nAlone and with no instructions, I stepped into the footprints and stood, nose to the wall and holding my property hanging by my arms at my side. After some time had passed, I heard a laugh and the sergeant say “you can throw him down the stairs if you need to.” That’s when I noticed that my feet had come off the footprints. In a panic, I fixed my feet and glanced behind me to see if I was still in danger. The sergeant had instructed one of his “run around” orderlies (an incarcerated person like myself) to fix my feet for me. Seeing that I’d done so myself, the orderly hesitated, obviously relieved, and the sergeant only laughed. Normally, just looking away from the wall would have been enough to merit violence, so I took his laugh as real evidence that I’d escaped harm by realizing on my own that my feet were misplaced.\nI myself ended up working as a runaround, and I worked for that sergeant for about four months. Though I managed to avoid committing violence on his behalf (much to his disappointment), I would not say that those four months were without trauma. Sergeant Moran has since been convicted of plotting to murder a former inmate, along with two other staff members, all of whom have been linked to the racist hate organization, the KKK.\nI have seen officers at Lake Butler RMC jumping up and down on incapacitated person’s faces. I have seen grown men slapped open-handed in the face by ‘correctional officers’ at Lake Butler RMC in front of hundreds of other men more times than I can count. I have seen officers at Lake Butler RMC smash a 17 year old child’s face through a pane of security glass (the kind with the wire in it) because of “his attitude”, and the next day they had a piece of paper with a smily face drawn on it taped over the broken glass.\nLake Butler Reception Medical Center is a bad place. For context, consider a similar institution: The Florida School for Boys, also known as the Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys. This reform school operated in the panhandle town of Marianna (equidistant from Talahassee as Lake Butler, but on the opposite side) from January 1, 1900, to June 30, 2011. Throughout its 111-year existence, the school gained a notorious reputation for abuse, assaults, and even student murders by staff members. Despite investigations, leadership changes, and promises of improvement, allegations of cruelty persisted. In 2009, a comprehensive investigation was ordered by the governor after a failed state inspection. Subsequent investigations in 2010 and 2011 substantiated claims of abuse and violence. Consequently, the school was permanently closed in June 2011. A survey by the University of South Florida revealed 55 burials on the school grounds, with most outside the designated cemetery area. The survey also documented nearly 100 deaths at the school.\nTo me and thousands of Florida citizens, Lake Butler Reception Medical Center represents a still-existent Dozier School, only for adults. The culture and norms that formed and supported the Dozier School are still present at Lake Butler, and it still today continues to act as a site of white racist repression, violence, and hate.\nI am greatly saddened that anyone would have to die there, in that nightmare of a place and wholly separated from those they love.\nHomicides\nHomicides By Facility\nThe chart below shows the number of homicides by facility. While it is possible that many of the homicides at Lake Butler RMC are individuals who were attacked at other facilities and then transferred to Lake Butler for medical treatment and subsequently counted as Lake Butler deaths (I’m sure any FDOC official would argue this to be the case), I personally don’t believe that this fully accounts for the entire homicide count at Lake Butler RMC.\n\n\nShow code\n\nviolent_FDOC <- deaths %>%\n  filter(Manner_Death ==\"Homicide\") %>%\n  mutate(month = floor_date(Date_Death, \"week\")) %>%\n  select(Date_Death, FACILITY_description)\n\nggplot(violent_FDOC, aes(x = reorder(FACILITY_description, FACILITY_description, function(x) length(x)))) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  geom_text(aes(label = ..count..), stat = \"count\", size =3.25, hjust = 1.5, color = \"white\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  xlab(\"FDOC Facilities\") + \n  ylab(\"Homicide Count\") +\n  scale_y_discrete(labels = scales::label_number(scale = 1)) +\n  ggtitle(\"FDOC Homicides by Facility July 2015- June 2023\") +\n  labs(caption = \"Figure 5\")\n\n\n\nAccidental Deaths\n\n\nShow code\n\nper_week_all4 <- deaths %>%\n  filter(Manner_Death== 'Accident') %>%\n  group_by(week = floor_date(Date_Death, unit = \"week\")) %>%\n  summarise(Total_week_Deaths = n())\n\nt_value <- function(data, indices) {\n  scores <- scores(data[indices], type = \"t\")\n  abs(scores)\n}\n# Bootstrap:\nboot_tee <- boot(per_week_all4$Total_week_Deaths, t_value, R = 10000)\nper_week_all4$p_values <- 1 - pnorm(boot_tee$t0)\nper_week_all4$high <- per_week_all4$p_values<=0.05\n\nggplot(per_week_all4, aes(x = week, y= Total_week_Deaths, col= high)) +\n  geom_rect(aes(xmin = as.Date(\"2020-03-09\"), xmax = as.Date(\"2021-08-25\"), ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf), fill = \"lightpink\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_col() +\n  scale_x_date(date_labels = \"%B, %Y\", date_breaks = \"6 months\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = as.Date(c(\"2015-07-02\", \"2023-06-29\"))) +\n  xlab(NULL) +\n  ylab('Count of Accidents') +\n  guides(color='none') +\n  annotate(geom=\"text\", label='2020 COVID 19 Florida Emergency', x=as.Date('2020-12-09'), y=-.25, size=2.5) +\n  labs(caption = \"Figure 6\")\n\n\n\nThe plot above shows the historical rate of occurrence of accidents resulting in deaths over the entire period covered by our data. To explain the coloration, the scores() algorithm utilizes the historical information available on frequency of accidental deaths to assess the probability of a given week being both ‘usual’ and having as many accidental deaths observed in that week as seen. The weeks that we see above displayed in blue are those weeks in which that calculated probability is less than 5%.\nThis spate of accidental deaths, it seems, did catch the notice of the Tampa Bay Times. According to the Times, the Florida prison system has long been considered one of the most dangerous in the US, with issues including violence, use-of-force by staff, and problems with delivery of health care. At the time, they reported that the Florida Department of Corrections was investigating the causes of the spike, with an increase in overdoses on synthetic drugs like K2 being pointed to as a possible contributing factor. https://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/Record-number-of-inmates-died-in-Florida-prisons-last-year-And-they-died-younger-than-past-years-_164715214/\nI was there, and I will tell you there was nothing to really investigate, the K2 wave that hit the FDOC was insane.\nSynthetic cannabinoids, also known as Spice or K2, are human-made chemicals designed to mimic the effects of THC, the primary psychoactive compound found in marijuana. They are often sprayed onto plant material and sold in small packages as a legal alternative to marijuana. The chemicals used to make synthetic cannabinoids are often changing, making them difficult to regulate and control. Synthetic cannabinoids entered the prison system around 2012, but it wasn’t until around 2016 that they became so prevalent that the whole tenor of one’s life for weeks-long cycles could be determined by the quality and caliber of the latest batch to come in.\nI’m talking about individuals having seizures on the sidewalks while nurses fail to respond. I’m talking about people lying in piles on the bathroom floor, hidden from sight alongside toilets so that they can smoke, unconscious, and covered in vomit. I’m talking about individuals screaming and thrashing, restrained and tied to their beds, and I’m talking about this happening consistently throughout the day, every day, all over the FDOC.\nHow those drugs get in is beyond the scope of this investigation (the officers bring it in – I mean, sure, they find a few little packages coming in through visitations always, but officers bring in POUNDS).\nAccidental Deaths by Facility\n\n\nShow code\n\naccidents_FDOC <- deaths %>% filter(Manner_Death == 'Accident')\nggplot(accidents_FDOC, aes(x = reorder(FACILITY_description, FACILITY_description, function(x) length(x)))) +\n  geom_bar() +   \n  geom_text(aes(label = ..count..), stat = \"count\", size =3.25, hjust = 1.5, color = \"white\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  xlab(\"FDOC Facilities\") + \n  ylab(\"Fatal Accident Count\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Fatal FDOC Accidents by Facility July 2015- June 2023\") +\n  labs(caption = \"Figure 7\")\n\n\n\nI would say, yes, those are the facilites with the worst k2 problems.

Once again, the weeks where the calculated probability of observing a result as extreme as the one seen is less than 5%.\nWhile it’s acknowledged that the pandemic has disrupted the normalcy of mortality rates, leading to a skewed baseline for expected deaths, this actually strengthens our case that the results here obtained using scores() are all the more salient and deserving of urgent attention, as the pandemic-induced distortions - resulting in a less sensitive scores() test - imply that any weeks yielding high scores are indicative of mortality rates that stand out as unusual even in the context of the pandemic.\nThe following weeks, filtered to exclude weeks during the 2020-2021 COVID emergency in Florida, stand out as exceptional in the FDOC with regards to the amount of natural deaths. While I refrain from positing any definitive explanations for why these particular facilities experienced heightened instances of natural deaths, I present this information as a potential avenue for future investigations by interested parties. The identification of any genuine causal relationships is of paramount interest, not only to the families who have lost loved ones during their incarceration but also to society at large, for a myriad of compelling reasons.\n\n\nShow code\n\ndepartmentwide <- per_week_natural %>%\n  filter((as.Date(week) <= as.Date(\"2020-03-09\") | as.Date(week) >= as.Date(\"2021-08-25\")) & high == TRUE & Total_week_Deaths > 2)\nkable(departmentwide %>% select(-high)) %>% \n  kable_styling(latex_options = \"hold_position\")\n\n\nweek\n\n\nTotal_week_Deaths\n\n\np_values\n\n\n2015-11-01\n\n\n12\n\n\n0.0444721\n\n\n2016-03-06\n\n\n12\n\n\n0.0444721\n\n\n2017-08-06\n\n\n12\n\n\n0.0444721\n\n\n2017-09-03\n\n\n12\n\n\n0.0444721\n\n\n2017-11-12\n\n\n12\n\n\n0.0444721\n\n\n2017-12-31\n\n\n13\n\n\n0.0220343\n\n\n2019-01-13\n\n\n14\n\n\n0.0099751\n\n\n2019-01-27\n\n\n13\n\n\n0.0220343\n\n\n2019-07-07\n\n\n12\n\n\n0.0444721\n\n\n2020-02-02\n\n\n13\n\n\n0.0220343\n\n\n2021-09-19\n\n\n14\n\n\n0.0099751\n\n\n2021-10-24\n\n\n12\n\n\n0.0444721\n\n\n2021-12-05\n\n\n12\n\n\n0.0444721\n\n\n2022-01-02\n\n\n12\n\n\n0.0444721\n\n\n2023-02-19\n\n\n13\n\n\n0.0220343\n\n\nGroupings Across Space, Natural Deaths\nIn the following analysis, we examine maps of groups of facilities that experienced months with statistically significant natural death counts. The plots that follow show all facilities that had at least one death during the respective month. The size and color of the markers correspond to the p-value, which represents the likelihood of observing such a high value for that facility based on its individual historical death data. Less likely results are plotted larger and redder than death counts that are more typical for that facility. You can see the labels for the facilities by hovering over the individual map markers.\nWhile it is valid to compare the p-values across maps by observing the size of the markers, it is not valid to compare colorations across maps at this time. This is because the colors of each map cover the spectrum of their respective associated data entries. Please note that this is a coding issue that I hope to fix soon.\n\n\nCoding work:\n\n\n\nDiscovering and Grouping Facilities\n\n\n\nper_month_natural2 <- deaths %>%\n  filter(Manner_Death == 'Natural') %>%\n  group_by(FACILITY_description, month = floor_date(Date_Death, unit = \"month\")) %>%\n  summarise(Total_month_naturalDeaths = n())\n\n\nt_value <- function(data, indices) {\n  scores <- scores(data[indices], type = \"t\")\n  abs(scores)\n}\n\nper_month_natural2 <- per_month_natural2 %>%\n  group_by(FACILITY_description) %>%\n  mutate(\n    t_values = boot(Total_month_naturalDeaths, t_value, R = 1000)$t0,  #

I will create a separate post for investigation of general OBIS data soon; however, I am including some data from it in this document to further our consideration of the FDOC’s handling of what I believe to be accidental deaths from overdose.\nIf you visit the OBIS database, you will find a set of tables that pertain to every person ever recorded as released from the FDOC.\nInterestingly, individuals who have died in the custody of the FDOC seem to have been ‘released’ in this manner, at least after approximately 1996.\n\n\nShow code\n\nx <- 10\nbase_dir <- \"/Users/johnwise/Downloads\"\n# Data Import\nRoot <- read_excel(paste0(base_dir, \"/Inmate_Release (3).XLSX\"))\nobis_deaths <- Root  %>% filter(releasedateflag_descr == 'deceased') %>% select(DCNumber, releasedateflag_descr, PrisonReleaseDate)\nobis_deaths %>%\n  head(x) %>%\n  kable(caption = paste(\"Omitting\", dim(obis_deaths)[1]-x, \"rows for display\")) %>%\n  kable_styling(latex_options = \"hold_position\")\n\n\nTable 1: Omitting 8278 rows for display\n\n\nDCNumber\n\n\nreleasedateflag_descr\n\n\nPrisonReleaseDate\n\n\n000001\n\n\ndeceased\n\n\n2005-04-24\n\n\n000062\n\n\ndeceased\n\n\n2014-12-09\n\n\n000198\n\n\ndeceased\n\n\n2013-06-27\n\n\n000329\n\n\ndeceased\n\n\n2014-08-29\n\n\n000418\n\n\ndeceased\n\n\n2013-05-13\n\n\n000517\n\n\ndeceased\n\n\n2008-12-12\n\n\n000645\n\n\ndeceased\n\n\n2005-08-14\n\n\n000741\n\n\ndeceased\n\n\n2023-05-14\n\n\n000791\n\n\ndeceased\n\n\n2020-05-30\n\n\n000828\n\n\ndeceased\n\n\n2010-10-17\n\n\n\n\nShow code\n\nggplot(obis_deaths, aes(x = as.Date(PrisonReleaseDate))) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"count\", width = 30, fill = \"steelblue\") +  # Adjust the width as needed\n  scale_x_date(date_breaks = \"6 months\", date_labels = \"%b %Y\") +\n  labs(x = \"Date of Prison Release\", y = \"Count\", title = \"Monthly Distribution of PrisonReleaseDate dates for persons coded 'deceased'\") +\n  theme_minimal() +  # Use a minimal theme\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1)) +  # Rotate x-axis labels for better readability\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = as.Date(c(\"1990-01-01\", \"2023-07-31\")), ylim = c(0, 200))\n\n\n\nLooks odd, right?

These anomalies are clearly noticeable when compared to the list of deaths in the Inmate Mortality data used throughout the rest of this document.\nTo further investigate this discrepancy, we will merge this peculiar dataset of PrisonReleaseDate dates with the aforementioned data. Then, we will calculate the differences in dates for each observation that matches by DCNumber.\n\n\nShow code\n\n# Calculating Date Differences\ndata <- merge(deaths, obis_deaths, by = 'DCNumber') %>%\n  select(-Name, -releasedateflag_descr, -FACILITY_descriptionn) %>%\n  mutate(\n    Date_Death = as.Date(Date_Death),\n    PrisonReleaseDate = as.Date(PrisonReleaseDate),\n    Days_Between = as.numeric(PrisonReleaseDate - Date_Death)\n  ) %>%\n  select(Date_Death, PrisonReleaseDate, Days_Between, Manner_Death)\ndata %>%\n  head(x) %>%\n  kable(caption = paste(\"Omitting\", dim(data)[1]-x, \"rows for display\")) %>%\n  kable_styling(latex_options = \"hold_position\")\n\n\nTable 2: Omitting 3215 rows for display\n\n\nDate_Death\n\n\nPrisonReleaseDate\n\n\nDays_Between\n\n\nManner_Death\n\n\n2023-05-08\n\n\n2023-05-14\n\n\n6\n\n\nNatural\n\n\n2020-05-29\n\n\n2020-05-30\n\n\n1\n\n\nNatural\n\n\n2019-06-04\n\n\n2019-06-05\n\n\n1\n\n\nNatural\n\n\n2015-11-27\n\n\n2015-11-28\n\n\n1\n\n\nNatural\n\n\n2016-06-15\n\n\n2016-06-16\n\n\n1\n\n\nNatural\n\n\n2017-07-06\n\n\n2017-07-07\n\n\n1\n\n\nNatural\n\n\n2019-07-21\n\n\n2019-07-22\n\n\n1\n\n\nNatural\n\n\n2020-04-09\n\n\n2020-04-10\n\n\n1\n\n\nNatural\n\n\n2019-04-07\n\n\n2019-04-08\n\n\n1\n\n\nAccident\n\n\n2015-11-26\n\n\n2015-11-27\n\n\n1\n\n\nNatural\n\n\n\n\nShow code\n\npoint_size <- 3\njitter_amount <- 25\n\nggplot(data, aes(x = as.Date(Date_Death), y = as.Date(PrisonReleaseDate), color = Days_Between, shape = Manner_Death)) +\n  geom_point(size = point_size, position = position_jitter(width = jitter_amount, height = jitter_amount)) +\n  scale_color_gradient(low = \"blue\", high = \"red\", name = \"Difference Dates, days\") +\n  labs(x = \"Date of Death\", y = \"Date of Prison Release\", title = \"Relationship between Date_Death and PrisonReleaseDate, observed FDOC Deaths\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\nZooming in to the interesting part!\n\n\nShow code\n\npoint_size <- 3\nx_jitter_amount <- 1450\ny_jitter_amount <- 20\n\nggplot(data, aes(x = as.Date(Date_Death), y = as.Date(PrisonReleaseDate), color = Days_Between, shape = Manner_Death)) +\n  geom_point(size = point_size, position = position_jitterdodge(jitter.width = x_jitter_amount, jitter.height = y_jitter_amount)) +\n  scale_color_gradient(low = \"blue\", high = \"red\", name = \"Difference Dates, days\") +\n  labs(x = \"DateDeath\", y = \"Date of PrisonReleaseDate\", title = \"Relationship between Date_Death and PrisonReleaseDate, observed FDOC Deaths\") +\n  scale_y_date(date_labels = \"%Y\", date_breaks = \"6 months\") +  # Include year on y-axis labels\n  theme_minimal() +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = as.Date(c(\"2016-06-01\", \"2017-12-31\")), ylim = as.Date(c(\"2020-06-01\", \"2020-12-31\")))\n\n\n\nWhat you see here is the same plot as above, but zoomed in on the red cluster. The points representing manners of death have been slightly separated to improve visibility.\nExplaining what it represents is more challenging and depends on how the FDOC uses PrisonReleaseDate for coding. My assumption is that it is a date that signifies when a person is legally ‘released’ in a specific way with a defined legal meaning.\nBased on the data, it appears that the FDOC intentionally delayed processing these death records. This delay is evident as the difference in dates for these observations is much larger compared to others (which have a difference of less than 90 days). Then, the FDOC processed their entire backlog in a single day, right in the midst of the pandemic.\nIt seems that the processing of these individuals’ paperwork was held for 3.5 years, presumably for a valid reason.\n\n\nShow code\n\nfiltered_data <- data %>% filter(Days_Between > 90)\np <- ggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = PrisonReleaseDate)) +\n  geom_histogram(fill = \"blue\", color = \"black\", bins = 30) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"PrisonReleaseDate for those 'released' more than 90 days after Date_Death\",\n    x = \"Prison Release Date\",\n    y = \"Frequency\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n# Calculate the count of observations on a specific date\ncount_date <- filtered_data %>%\n  group_by(PrisonReleaseDate) %>%\n  summarise(count = n())\n\nannotation_date <- as.Date(\"2020-09-30\")\ncount_for_annotation <- count_date %>%\n  filter(PrisonReleaseDate == annotation_date) %>%\n  pull(count)\np + \n  annotate(\"text\", x = annotation_date-910, y = 198, label = paste(\"September 30, 2020:\", count_for_annotation, \"PrisonReleaseDate deaths\"), vjust = 1.5)\n\n\n\nMy point is that I need more data.\n\n\n\n",
