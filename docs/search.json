She was a very cranky and particular girl, but, still, she accepted me and welcomed me home immediately. We miss Yuki terribly.\n\n\nJinx\n\n\nThis is Jinx! She and her brother and sister were baby kittens under the deck of our house when we moved in, and they have all been the best cats ever!\n\n\nBruiser\n\n\nBruiser is a big sweet silly goof.\n\n\nLadybird\n\n\nAnd this is Ladybird, who, if you ask her, is an only child, at least out in public. She’s the most precious and delicate little sweetheart, as long as she’s not hunting lizards!\n\n\nEveryone\n\n\nHere are more pictures of those same cats! You’re welcome!\n\n\n\n\n",
