  mutate(row_num = row_number()) %>%
  filter(row_num <= 2) %>%

Discovering the amount of time each returned person was free last time they were out
```{r}

  summarise(TimeOut = as.numeric(difftime(max(ReceiptDate, na.rm = TRUE), max(ReleaseDate, na.rm = TRUE), units = "days"))) %>% # Note, there were 7 entires for which a negative time free was calculated. Investigation shows
  filter(TimeOut >= 0) # that this is due to these individuals having missing most ReceiptDate for most recent conviction.
# We omit these 7 observations for the purpose of this analysis
```
Determining how many times each person has been incarcerated
```{r}
times_in <- returners %>%

```
Removing outlier, binning data
```{r}
# Not sure why the FDOC has the individual with DC Number 872984 as initially coming to prison on 1901-01-01, 
#but we will omit this individual from our analyses as well.
returners_a <- returners_a[-which(returners_a['DCNumber']=='872984'),]

# Create the 'times_in_bins' column

# Inital Look
```{r fig.align = 'center', code_folding = TRUE}
prop_returned <- round(dim(returners_a)[1]/dim(Root)[1],2)
mean_incarcerations <- round((sum(returners_a$times_in) + dim(first_timers)[1])/dim(Root)[1],2)

new_data <- data.frame(times_in_bins = rep("First FDOC Commitment", dim(first_timers)[1]))
combined_data <- rbind(returners_a %>% select(times_in_bins), new_data)
ggplot(combined_data, aes(x = "", fill = times_in_bins)) +
  geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "count") +
  coord_polar("y", start = 0) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#2c7bb6", "#abd9e9" ,"#ffffbf", "#fdae61", "#e6e6e6", "#7f3b00")) +
  theme_void() +  # Remove axis and grid lines
  labs(title = "Times Incarcerated, Currently Incarcerated FDOC Population", fill = "Times FDOC Incarcerated")
```

Amazingly, a full `r prop_returned * 100`% of our currently incarcerated population has served time previously. The Florida Department of Corrections (FDOC) seems to appreciate repeat customers; I've heard them say so myself.
Furthermore, the average number of times a person has been incarcerated across the entire population is `r mean_incarcerations`. In other words, the average person currently incarcerated in FDOC has been incarcerated more than twice before.

What does this information imply about the argument for incarceration as a deterrent?

Regarding the argument on incarceration as a deterrent, I pose this question: How many crimes has the threat of incarceration prevented YOU from committing?

If your answer is "none," then you are likely in the majority. 

If your response is "none, but I'm not a criminal," then it is worth reflecting on the following: Who are the criminals? What do they look like? Where do they come from? Which neighborhoods do they reside in? How comfortable are you with your answers?

## Time Free Since Last Release

Next, we should examine the amount of time that those who are currently incarcerated in Florida were free in between their current and their last incarceration:

```{r fig.align='center', fig.height=5, fig.width=10, code_folding = TRUE}
quartiles <- round(quantile(returners_a$TimeOut, probs = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))/365.25, 1)

color_palette <- c("#ffffff", "#e6e6e6", "#bfbfbf", "#808080", "#404040", "#000000")



# Create the first plot (plota)
plota <- ggplot(returners_a, aes(x = 1, y = TimeOut / 365.25, color = prev_TimeServed_bins, group = 1)) +
  geom_sina(alpha = 0.5, position = 'dodge') +
  geom_violin(alpha = 0.1, color = "black") +
  scale_color_manual(values = color_palette, name = 'Served') +
  ylab("Years Free") +
  theme_void() +  # Remove axis and grid lines
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text()) +  # Keep y-axis labels
  labs(title = "Years Free, Shaded by Previous Fl. Time Served")


color_palette <- c("#ffffff", "#e6e6e6", "#404040", "#000000")

# Create the second plot (plotb)
plotb <- ggplot(returners_a, aes(x = 1, y = TimeOut / 365.25, color = times_in_bins, group = 1)) +
  geom_sina(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_violin(alpha = 0.1, color = "black") +
  scale_color_manual(values = color_palette, name = 'Number of Bids') +
  ylab(NULL) +
  theme_void() +  # Remove axis and grid lines
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text()) +  # Keep y-axis labels
  labs(title = "Years Free, Shaded by Number of Incarcerations")

# Customize plot margins for both plots
plota <- plota + theme(plot.margin = margin(0, 0, 0, 0, unit = "pt"))
plotb <- plotb + theme(plot.margin = margin(0, 0, 0, 0, unit = "pt"))

# Arrange the plots using grid.arrange
grid.arrange(plota, plotb, ncol = 2, top = "Respite Amidst Most Recent Incarcerations, Current FDOC Population")
```

It is evident from the visuals that a majority of individuals currently incarcerated in Florida with a history of previous FDOC incarceration did not have a significant period of freedom before their current imprisonment. Interestingly, there is also a pattern where individuals who had served long sentences in the past or multiple sentences were unable to remain free for long before being incarcerated again. These patterns are shown by the darker points towards the bottom of the visuals. While one might (naively) expect that spending more time in prison or having multiple sentences would make individuals better equipped to stay out longer and remain free, in reality it is not surprising to see evidence here that the longer someone is inside, the *less* equipped they are to navigate the challenges after release.

### Time Free

```{r code_folding = TRUE}
quartile_table <- data.frame(
  "Quartile" = c("Q1", "Median (Q2)", "Q3"),
  Years_Free = quartiles
)

kable(quartile_table) %>% 
  kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position")

```


For individuals who are currently incarcerated and have previously served time in Florida, a quarter of them were returned to prison in less than 1.8 years after their most recent release, while half of them were not out longer than 3.2 years. Furthermore, only 25% of them managed to stay out of prison for more than 5.7 years.

It is clear that many people are going back to prison very quickly, which raises concerns.

Think about this, however: having 3.2 years of freedom is actually enough time for someone to regain some responsibilities and dignity -- it is already difficult to regain these once (or maybe gain them for the first time), but to only have a fleeting taste of them? I do not know that I could recover from something like that.

# Charges

For each person who is currently incarcerated and has at least one prior incarceration, we have data on all adjudications for their current and past incarcerations.
Regarding those currently incarcerated, we observe that they are serving time for a wide range of adjudication charges. There are 863 different charges for which these individuals are currently incarcerated.

```{r}
returners_hist <- merge(returners_a, Offenses_CPS, by = 'DCNumber')
returners_hist$adjudicationcharge_descr <- as.factor(returners_hist$adjudicationcharge_descr)

charges <- returners_hist %>%
  group_by(adjudicationcharge_descr) %>%
  summarize(charge_count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(charge_count))
charges
```

### Proportions of Charges (not persons)
```{r}
returners_hist$crime_category <- as.factor(returners_hist$crime_category)
category_counts <- summary(returners_hist$crime_category)
total_entries <- sum(category_counts)
category_percentages <- (category_counts / total_entries) * 100
rounded_percentages <- round(category_percentages, 2)
print(rounded_percentages)
```

Categorizing crimes in this manner is a highly laborious task. I had to make numerous decisions regarding the classification of crimes which often felt arbitrary even to myself. It is important to note that there are many other equally valid, and possibly even superior, crime categorization schemas. Furthermore, please be aware that crime categories are actively being reviewed and adjusted. If you come across any errors or inconsistencies, or would like have an alternate schema considered, please contact me.

I do not like how low the Probation/Parole Violations seem to be, seems to be an error almost, so the next step is to investigate that surprising result throughly.

```{r}
wrk <- returners_hist %>% select(DCNumber, crime_category)
result <- wrk %>% 
  group_by(DCNumber) %>% 
  mutate(crimes_categories = paste(crime_category, collapse = "; ")) %>%
  select(-crime_category) %>%
  unique()
```

```{r}
result <- result %>%
  separate_rows(crimes_categories, sep = "; ") %>%
  count(DCNumber, crimes_categories) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = crimes_categories, values_from = n, values_fill = 0)
```

Here we have my first pass at establishing the proportions of currently incarcerated returning persons assocated with each crime category.

```{r}
result_df <- data.frame(Category = character(0), Proportion = numeric(0))
categories <- colnames(result)[-1]
for (category in categories) {
  num_associated_rows <- result %>%
    filter(get(category) > 0) %>%
    nrow()
  proportion <- round(num_associated_rows / nrow(result), 2)
  result_df <- rbind(result_df, data.frame(Category = category, Proportion = proportion))
}
print(result_df)
```
In the analysis, it is observed that among the individuals currently incarcerated in FDOC who have previously served time in FDOC, 54% have at least one Burglary, Theft, or Property crime associated with their current incarceration, while 42% have been associated with at least one crime from the violent crime category, and so on. The proportions sum to greater than 100 because many individuals are associated with multiple crime categories.

I really suggest that someone double-check the crime categorizations for accuracy. If these results are indeed true, they are quite shocking.
