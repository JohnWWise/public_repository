Isolating first-timers
```{r}
first_timers <- Incarhist %>%
  arrange(DCNumber, desc(ReceiptDate)) %>%
  group_by(DCNumber) %>%
  mutate(row_num = row_number()) %>%
  filter(row_num <= 2) %>%
  select(-row_num) %>%
  count(DCNumber) %>%
  filter(n==1)

returners <- anti_join(Incarhist, first_timers, by ='DCNumber')
# grab the two most recent receipts of those who have returned
returners_current_and_last <- returners %>%
  arrange(DCNumber, desc(ReceiptDate)) %>%
  group_by(DCNumber) %>%
  mutate(row_num = row_number()) %>%

```
Calculate total time served for each person prior to most recent incarceration
```{r}

  group_by(DCNumber) %>%
  summarize(prev_TimeServed = sum(time_served, na.rm = TRUE))
```
Discovering the amount of time each returned person was free last time they were out
```{r}
returners_time_free <- returners_current_and_last %>%
  group_by(DCNumber) %>%
  summarise(TimeOut = as.numeric(difftime(max(ReceiptDate, na.rm = TRUE), max(ReleaseDate, na.rm = TRUE), units = "days"))) %>% # Note, there were 7 entires for which a negative time free was calculated. Investigation shows
  filter(TimeOut >= 0) # that this is due to these individuals having missing most ReceiptDate for most recent conviction.
# We omit these 7 observations for the purpose of this analysis
```
Determining how many times each person has been incarcerated
```{r}
times_in <- returners %>%
  group_by(DCNumber) %>%
  summarize(times_in = n())
```
Going back to fetch general information on those isolated, compiling with calculated values
```{r}
returners_a <- merge(merge(merge(Root, returners_time_free, by = 'DCNumber'), served_prior, by = 'DCNumber'), times_in, by = 'DCNumber')
```
Removing outlier, binning data
```{r}
# Not sure why the FDOC has the individual with DC Number 872984 as initially coming to prison on 1901-01-01, 
#but we will omit this individual from our analyses as well.
returners_a <- returners_a[-which(returners_a['DCNumber']=='872984'),]

# Create the 'times_in_bins' column
returners_a$times_in_bins <- cut(returners_a$times_in,
                                 breaks = c(2, 3, 4, 6, 17),
                                 labels = c("2 bids", "3 bids", "4-6 bids", "6-17 bids"),
                                 include.lowest = TRUE)

# Create the 'prev_TimeServed_bins' column

returners_a$prev_TimeServed_bins <- cut(returners_a$prev_TimeServed / 365.25,
                                       breaks = breaks,
                                       labels = labels,

# Inital Look
```{r fig.align = 'center', code_folding = TRUE}
prop_returned <- round(dim(returners_a)[1]/dim(Root)[1],2)
mean_incarcerations <- round((sum(returners_a$times_in) + dim(first_timers)[1])/dim(Root)[1],2)

new_data <- data.frame(times_in_bins = rep("First FDOC Commitment", dim(first_timers)[1]))
combined_data <- rbind(returners_a %>% select(times_in_bins), new_data)
ggplot(combined_data, aes(x = "", fill = times_in_bins)) +
  geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "count") +
  coord_polar("y", start = 0) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#2c7bb6", "#abd9e9" ,"#ffffbf", "#fdae61", "#e6e6e6", "#7f3b00")) +
  theme_void() +  # Remove axis and grid lines
  labs(title = "Times Incarcerated, Currently Incarcerated FDOC Population", fill = "Times FDOC Incarcerated")
```

Amazingly, a full `r prop_returned * 100`% of our currently incarcerated population has served time previously. The Florida Department of Corrections (FDOC) seems to appreciate repeat customers; I've heard them say so myself.
Furthermore, the average number of times a person has been incarcerated across the entire population is `r mean_incarcerations`. In other words, the average person currently incarcerated in FDOC has been incarcerated more than twice before.

What does this information imply about the argument for incarceration as a deterrent?

Regarding the argument on incarceration as a deterrent, I pose this question: How many crimes has the threat of incarceration prevented YOU from committing?

If your answer is "none," then you are likely in the majority. 

If your response is "none, but I'm not a criminal," then it is worth reflecting on the following: Who are the criminals? What do they look like? Where do they come from? Which neighborhoods do they reside in? How comfortable are you with your answers?

## Time Free Since Last Release

Next, we should examine the amount of time that those who are currently incarcerated in Florida were free in between their current and their last incarceration:

```{r fig.align='center', fig.height=5, fig.width=10, code_folding = TRUE}
quartiles <- round(quantile(returners_a$TimeOut, probs = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))/365.25, 1)

color_palette <- c("#ffffff", "#e6e6e6", "#bfbfbf", "#808080", "#404040", "#000000")



# Create the first plot (plota)
plota <- ggplot(returners_a, aes(x = 1, y = TimeOut / 365.25, color = prev_TimeServed_bins, group = 1)) +
  geom_sina(alpha = 0.5, position = 'dodge') +
  geom_violin(alpha = 0.1, color = "black") +
  scale_color_manual(values = color_palette, name = 'Served') +
  ylab("Years Free") +
  theme_void() +  # Remove axis and grid lines
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text()) +  # Keep y-axis labels
  labs(title = "Years Free, Shaded by Previous Fl. Time Served")


color_palette <- c("#ffffff", "#e6e6e6", "#404040", "#000000")

# Create the second plot (plotb)
plotb <- ggplot(returners_a, aes(x = 1, y = TimeOut / 365.25, color = times_in_bins, group = 1)) +
  geom_sina(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_violin(alpha = 0.1, color = "black") +
  scale_color_manual(values = color_palette, name = 'Number of Bids') +
  ylab(NULL) +
  theme_void() +  # Remove axis and grid lines
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text()) +  # Keep y-axis labels
  labs(title = "Years Free, Shaded by Number of Incarcerations")

# Customize plot margins for both plots
plota <- plota + theme(plot.margin = margin(0, 0, 0, 0, unit = "pt"))
plotb <- plotb + theme(plot.margin = margin(0, 0, 0, 0, unit = "pt"))

# Arrange the plots using grid.arrange
grid.arrange(plota, plotb, ncol = 2, top = "Respite Amidst Most Recent Incarcerations, Current FDOC Population")
```

It is evident from the visuals that a majority of individuals currently incarcerated in Florida with a history of previous FDOC incarceration did not have a significant period of freedom before their current imprisonment. Interestingly, there is also a pattern where individuals who had served long sentences in the past or multiple sentences were unable to remain free for long before being incarcerated again. These patterns are shown by the darker points towards the bottom of the visuals. While one might (naively) expect that spending more time in prison or having multiple sentences would make individuals better equipped to stay out longer and remain free, in reality it is not surprising to see evidence here that the longer someone is inside, the *less* equipped they are to navigate the challenges after release.

### Time Free

```{r code_folding = TRUE}
quartile_table <- data.frame(
  "Quartile" = c("Q1", "Median (Q2)", "Q3"),
  Years_Free = quartiles
)

kable(quartile_table) %>% 
  kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position")

```


For individuals who are currently incarcerated and have previously served time in Florida, a quarter of them were returned to prison in less than 1.8 years after their most recent release, while half of them were not out longer than 3.2 years. Furthermore, only 25% of them managed to stay out of prison for more than 5.7 years.

It is clear that many people are going back to prison very quickly, which raises concerns.

Think about this, however: having 3.2 years of freedom is actually enough time for someone to regain some responsibilities and dignity -- it is already difficult to regain these once (or maybe gain them for the first time), but to only have a fleeting taste of them? I do not know that I could recover from something like that.

# Charges

```{r code_folding = TRUE}
returners_hist <- merge(returners_a, Offenses_CPS, by = 'DCNumber')
returners_hist$adjudicationcharge_descr <- as.factor(returners_hist$adjudicationcharge_descr)

charges <- returners_hist %>%
  group_by(adjudicationcharge_descr) %>%
  summarize(charge_count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(charge_count))

raw_charges <- rbind(Offenses_CPS %>% select(adjudicationcharge_descr), Offenses_PRPR %>% select(adjudicationcharge_descr))
raw_charges$adjudicationcharge_descr <- gsub("[+$]", "", raw_charges$adjudicationcharge_descr)
raw_charges$adjudicationcharge_descr <- as.factor(raw_charges$adjudicationcharge_descr)
charges_counts <- raw_charges %>%
  group_by(adjudicationcharge_descr) %>%
  summarize(charge_count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(charge_count))
```


Currently incarcerated individuals are associated with 1,124 different charges across all past and current incarcerations.

```{r code_folding = TRUE}
datatable(unique(charges_counts), options = list(scrollX = TRUE, pageLength = 10, lengthMenu = c(10, 20, 50)))
```

In order to proceed, I had to reduce these 1,124 categories to something workable, I needed more general categories of crimes -- drug crimes, violent crimes, etc. Categorizing crimes is a time-consuming process that requires making multiple classification decisions, so I encourage everyone to review the crime categorizations by clicking the disclosure triangle icon next to "View Crime Category Mappings". If any errors or inconsistencies are found, or if you wish to suggest an alternative classification framework, please don't hesitate to contact me.

### Aside: Limitation Caused by Poor Data Coding -- Probation/Parole/Conditional Release Violations
While I initially intended to analyze probation/parole violations among individuals currently incarcerated with a previous history of incarceration using this data, it is not currently possible to conduct a straightforward analysis. This is because the Florida Department of Corrections categorizes individuals who are currently incarcerated and have violated their probation/parole under the charge for which they were originally sentenced to probation or parole.

For instance, let's consider the following record, with all identifying information censored. This person was initially incarcerated in 1961 for an unspecified sexual battery crime and received a life sentence. It is important to note that the meaning of a life sentence in 1961 differed significantly from its present-day interpretation. They were released on parole in 1967. After 17 years of freedom, they were arrested in Orange County. Although they were not apparently convicted of a new crime, their detainment resulted in the revocation of their parole, and they have been in prison ever since.

:::

However, the FDOC incorrectly lists this person as currently in prison for the 1961 unspecified sexual battery offense. There are several issues with this, the most significant being that it is not true. This person is NOT in prison for any form of sexual battery, but rather is still ensnared in the legal fallout from the 1961 conviction -- after 17 years of freedom, these are different things, certainly.

Okay, so among those currently incarcerated for their first commitment, 4.6% of them have Abuse/Neglect crimes associated with their current incarceration. However, this percentage drops to 2.2% for those serving time for their second incarceration. Furthermore, we see a further decrease to 1.9% across the population of those who are serving their third sentence in FDOC, and so on.



```{r code_folding = TRUE}
# I'm running a Mann-Kendall test for trends, really I should prob run a chi squared, but I don't know how to account
# for the overlaping crime categories (rape, for example, is both a sex and violent crime) - Mann-Kendall should suffice
# our investigation, however. If you feel that chi squared or another test is needed then reach out and we'll make it happen.
mannkendall_results <- apply(pros_across_times[,-1], MARGIN=1, FUN=MannKendall)

# Add the results as a new column to the data frame
pros_across_times$tau <- sapply(mannkendall_results,function(x) x$tau)
pros_across_times$pvalue <- sapply(mannkendall_results,function(x) x$sl)
sigs_across_times <- pros_across_times %>%
  filter(pvalue<= 0.05) %>%
  select(`Crime Category`, tau, pvalue)
kable(sigs_across_times) %>% 
  kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position")
```

We do have strong statistical evidence that indicates a trend of decreasing Abuse/Neglect Crimes, Sex Crimes, and Violent Crimes. We also see in increase in the percentage of Burglary, Theft, Property Crimes, as well as Drug Offenses.

# Next Steps
I can create a table for individual crime adjudications, similar to how I presented a table and graph displaying proportions of crime categories across successive incarcerations. This table would show statistically significant trends based on the number of incarcerations. However, conducting this analysis poses a challenge due to the large number of potential adjudications. To mitigate the risk of type 1 errors, I am currently exploring more conservative tests that can be applied, in addition to the Mann-Kendall test.

Following that, I will analyze correlations and relationships among multiple incarcerations *per individual* — I will compare the current charges of individuals currently incarcerated with their charges of previous incarcerations.

Finally, I will examine this data based on the county of last conviction. 

I anticipate identifying further analysis opportunities as I complete these tasks.
