title: "FDOC Returns"
description: |
  This document is an ongoing investigation into the data available on individuals who have returned to prison. I choose not to use the term "recidivism" because it is often associated with a punitive and stigmatizing perspective on individuals who have been involved with the criminal legal system. The term implies a focus on reoffending and the idea of a "criminal" identity, rather than acknowledging the complex social, economic, and systemic factors at play.

This document is an ONGOING mining of that data. Keep an eye out for my newsletter (which doesnâ€™t exist yet) for updates, or press f5 to refresh.
