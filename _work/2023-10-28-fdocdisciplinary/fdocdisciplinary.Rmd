  This document presents an ongoing investigation into the data available through the FDLE on FDOC Disciplinary actions. (Investigation begun 2023-10-28, it's still in very rough and preliminary form)
output:
  distill::distill_article:
    toc: true
    toc_float: true

Thank you Max at Community Spring for bringing to my attention that the FDLE collects incarceration data from the Florida Department of Corrections. This investigation will utilize that data, which is available from the [Florida Department of Law Enforcement](https://www.fdle.state.fl.us/CJAB/CJDT/FDC-IS-Reports), but I would not recommend looking at the FDLE dashboard because it's not very useful.

So, the FDLE has a table that, once trimmed of all irrelevant data, looks like this:
Data on people:

```{r}
# Just the summary data, mr computer plez 
summary(root)
```

All identifying information has been removed from these data. The supervision ID appears to be a unique FDLE internal identifier.

However, the records do seem to represent the entire population under the supervision or custody of the Florida Department of Corrections.

It appears that they do have every disciplinary action taken against these individuals, just recorded in a separate table.

```{r}
# now the other one plz mr computer
summary(disc)
```
Unfortunately, it appears that the records for disciplinary actions only span a year and a half, from Feburary 2022 to September 2023, but we have 390,545 recorded disciplinary actions altogether.

The plot above displays the counts of rule violation accusations made by FDOC staff against currently incarcerated individuals in the Florida Department of Corrections, and it uses different colors to represent the outcomes of the disciplinary process.

It is important to note that the plot shows the count of rule violations themselves, not the count of individuals who have been charged or faced consequences for these actions. It is common for individuals to be charged with multiple violations for a single action. For example, throwing a tray to the ground can result in charges of both disorderly conduct and destruction of state property. In such cases, a person could expect to be confined for 30 days and lose 30 days of previously-earned gain time, along with whatever else gets thrown at them.

These plots provide valuable information. However, it's important to consider that when looking at the incidence of outcomes among individuals charged with rule violations, the results may look different. For example, it is likely that nearly 100% of those actually incarcerated (currently this data still includes those on parole, etc.) who have been accused of 'disorderly conduct' have ended up in confinement with that charge. The presence of multiple disorderly conduct charges and the concurrent punishments (such as loss of gain time) during confinement is here obscuring the true measure of reliance that FDOC has on confinement.

# Collapsing Rule Violations into Categories


Processing the 104 individual rule violations can be overwhelming. It would be more useful to categorize them into a smaller number of categories. For instance, violations such as 'disobeying a verbal or written order', 'disrespect of someone in authority', and 'disorderly conduct' could be categorized under 'officer got mad', along with many others. I will make the rule violation categories now.
