## **Welcome to my repository/website!**

My name is John Wise, and I spent nearly 19 years incarcerated in Florida. During my time inside, I dedicated myself to studying mathematics and data science with the aspiration of someday communicating my experience of being incarcerated.

This repository serves as a platform where I can share my endeavors, including my insights on incarceration and some of my creative writing. My main goals for creating this website are twofold:

1. To express my strong opposition to the practice of incarcerating people as punishment for crime, which I believe is absurd, wasteful, and perpetuates harm.
2. To showcase my work, with the hope of being discovered by potential sources of additional data.

Through this website, my goal is to raise awareness about the challenges faced by those who are or have been incarcerated, advocate for substantial and meaningful change in the criminal legal system, and work towards the closure of prisons.

Thank you for visiting my repository and joining me on this journey.
