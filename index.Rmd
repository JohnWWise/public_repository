## **Welcome to my repository/website!**

My name is John Wise, and I spent nearly 19 years incarcerated in Florida. During my time inside, I dedicated myself to studying mathematics and data science, driven by a desire to understand and articulate my experience of being incarcerated.

This repository has grown into a refuge for me. It is a platform where I can share my journey, my insights on incarceration, and my creative writing. The creation of this website has evolved into something deeply personal:

1. It is an expression of my resolute opposition to the practice of incarcerating people as punishment for crime, which I have come to see as not just wasteful, but absurd and harmful in its perpetuation.
2. This site is also a showcase for my work. However, more than seeking discovery or validation from external sources, I've found that the act of creating and sharing has become a form of therapy, a cathartic process that helps me process my experiences.

Through this website, I strive to raise awareness about the challenges faced by those who are or have been incarcerated, advocate for substantial and meaningful change in the criminal legal system, and work towards the closure of prisons.

I appreciate you visiting my repository and joining me on this journey. Your presence here bears witness to my experiences and contributes to my healing process. Thank you.
