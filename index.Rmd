## Welcome to my repository/website!

My name is John Wise, and I spent nearly 19 years incarcerated in Florida. During my time inside, I dedicated myself to studying mathematics and data science with the aspiration of sharing my journey and experiences of being incarcerated.

This repository serves as a platform where I can share my endeavors, including my insights on incarceration, as well as some of my creative writing. It is my sincere hope that my work will contribute to a greater understanding of the challenges faced by those who have been incarcerated and foster meaningful conversations.

Thank you for visiting my repository and joining me on this journey.
