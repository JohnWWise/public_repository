  <h2>Yuki</h2>

  <p>This is Yuki. My partner of the time had her, a rescue of a rescue, for about a year before I came home, and she was already very senior. She was a very cranky and particular girl, but, still, she accepted me and welcomed me home immediately. We both miss her very much.</p>

  <p>And this is Ladybird, who, if you ask her, is an only child, at least out in public. She's the most precious and delicate little sweetheart, as long as she's not hunting lizards!</p>
